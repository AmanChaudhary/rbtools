===========================
RBTools 0.7.2 Release Notes
===========================

**Release date:** March 9, 2015


New Features
============

* Added two new commands: :command:`rbt login` and :command:`rbt logout`.

  These commands make it easy to log in or out of Review Board without
  having to perform other operations on the server.

  :command:`rbt login` will prompt the user for credentials, log in to
  Review Board, and store the session cookie. The credentials can
  optionally be provided by passing :option:`--username` and
  :option:`--password`.

  :command:`rbt logout` will log out of the Review Board server, invalidating
  the cookie. The cookie will then be removed from the cookies file.


Bug Fixes
=========

rbt land
--------

* Fixed using :option:`--edit` when landing remote changes.

  Previously, this option was being ignored, requiring the commit to be
  amended later.

* The change description is no longer printed to the console when using
  :option:`--edit`.


rbt post
--------

* Fixed issues posting changes against Git repositories hosted on Bitbucket,
  Beanstalk, and Unfuddle.

  When running against Review Board 2.0.13 or older, we must go into a
  compatibility mode for diff validation. We recommend upgrading to
  2.0.14 or higher.


API Caching
-----------

* API caching is now disabled for Review Board 2.0.13 and lower.

  We found some other caching problems that were worth working around in
  2.0.13 by disabling the cache. It now requires the upcoming 2.0.14 and
  higher.
